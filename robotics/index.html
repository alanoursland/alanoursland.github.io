      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Cognitoware Robotics</strong> is a C++ library implementing the core algorithms of probabilistic robotics—state estimation, filtering, and stochastic modeling. 
      The project was first released more than a decade ago and has been continuously available as open source since then.</p>

      <p>The library provides compact, readable implementations of Gaussian filters, Bayes and Markov models, and basic mathematical utilities for estimation research and teaching. 
      It is designed to stay close to the equations presented in <em>Probabilistic Robotics</em> by Thrun, Burgard, and Fox, and is often used as a lightweight reference implementation for those studying or prototyping estimation systems.</p>

      <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Focused — implements core probabilistic concepts without middleware or platform code.</li>
        <li>Readable — small, modern C++ codebase reflecting the underlying mathematics clearly.</li>
        <li>Dependable — stable, self-contained, and maintained with minimal external dependencies.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The project remains self-contained on GitHub, where source code, examples, and licensing information are maintained. This page exists primarily to document its origin and association with Cognitoware LLC.</p>
