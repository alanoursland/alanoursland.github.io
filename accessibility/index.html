    <h1>Accessibility at Cognitoware</h1>

    <p>
      Cognitoware LLC is committed to providing a website that is accessible to all users.
      Our site is designed and coded with simplicity and clarity in mind, using semantic HTML
      and lightweight CSS for fast, predictable performance across browsers and devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      We follow the principles of the
      <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 Level AA
      standards wherever practical. Pages are tested for keyboard navigation, logical heading
      structure, sufficient color contrast, and scalable text. We also avoid flashing content
      and rely on text rather than images to convey information.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site does not use cookies, analytics, or any tracking scripts. It is purely
      informational and hosted on GitHub Pages.
