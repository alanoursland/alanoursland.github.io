    <h1>Beam Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Beam Workout Tracker is built with privacy in mind. All workout information is stored locally on your device and
      is never sent to Cognitoware LLC or any other party.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information Storage and Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>On-device data:</strong> Exercises, sets, reps, weights, and notes are stored securely within Apple’s application sandbox on your device.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Exports:</strong> You can export data using standard Apple share sheets (for example, to JSON or CSV). Beam never uploads or shares data automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User feedback:</strong> If you choose to email exported exercise lists or similar files to Cognitoware to suggest improvements or report issues, that data is used only for app development and testing. 
        Beam’s export files do not contain personal information unless you include it yourself (for example, as part of a custom exercise name).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Beam does not include analytics or third-party crash reporting. Apple may collect anonymous diagnostic information as part of its platform services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Imported Data:</strong> Beam may offer optional exercise templates downloaded from the Cognitoware website during setup. 
        These downloads are not tracked, do not include personal information, and are served as static files.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. No Accounts or Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Beam does not require or create user accounts, does not use cloud synchronization, and contains no advertising,
      tracking, or profiling technologies.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Your Control</h2>
    <p>
      You can delete all workout data at any time using the in-app “Delete All Data” option or by removing the app from
      your device. Any files you export or share are entirely under your control.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      Beam relies on Apple’s system-level security and encryption to protect data stored on your device. No data is
      transmitted to Cognitoware LLC.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Beam is not directed to children under 13 years of age and does not knowingly collect personal information from
      minors.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated as Beam evolves. The current version will always be available on this page with
      the effective date shown above.
    </p>
