    <h1>Beam Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Month Day, Year]</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>Beam Workout Tracker is built with privacy in mind. We collect as little information as possible and store most data directly on your device.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local data:</strong> Workout and exercise information you log in Beam stays on your device by default.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional data sync:</strong> If Beam later supports cloud sync or backup, it will be clearly explained and optional.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Anonymous error logs may be collected to improve app stability. These contain no personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>Data is used solely to provide and improve Beam. We do not sell, rent, or share personal information with advertisers or third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You control your data. You can delete your workout history from within the app at any time. If you use an optional cloud feature, you may request deletion by emailing <a href="mailto:beam-feedback@cognitoware.com">beam-feedback@cognitoware.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>Beam uses modern encryption and Apple’s system protections to safeguard your information. However, no system is completely secure, and you use Beam at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Beam is intended for users 16 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>If this Privacy Policy changes, the updated version will be posted here with a new effective date. Substantive changes will be announced in the app or website.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
