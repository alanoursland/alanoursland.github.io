        <h1>Beam Workout Tracker</h1>
        <p>Fast, simple, and built for your workouts — not for data entry.</p>

        <h2>Designed for the moment you’re lifting</h2>
        <p>Beam is made to be effortless <em>during</em> a workout. Every screen, button, and gesture is tuned for speed
            and clarity so you can log your sets without breaking focus. Big touch targets, smooth transitions, and
            minimal typing — all optimized for one-hand use.</p>

        <h2>Structured data, zero friction</h2>
        <p>Beam stores your workouts as structured data — exercises, sets, reps, weight, and notes — so your history
            stays consistent and analyzable. Everything is local on your device and exportable in open formats. Your
            data is yours.</p>

        <h2>Privacy built in</h2>
        <p>No accounts. No ads. No tracking. Workouts sync securely through iCloud if you choose, or stay completely
            offline. Optional anonymous analytics help improve the app — nothing else leaves your phone.</p>

        <h2>Simple now, powerful later</h2>
        <p>The first version of Beam focuses entirely on ease of use and reliability. Future updates will add deeper
            insights — history grids, metrics, Apple&nbsp;Watch support, and performance analysis — built on the same
            clean data model.</p>
