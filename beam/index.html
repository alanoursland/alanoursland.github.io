    <h2>Designed for the moment you’re lifting</h2>
    <p>
      Beam is made to be effortless during a workout. Each screen and button is tuned for speed and clarity so you can
      log sets quickly and stay focused.
    </p>

    <h2>Organized and private</h2>
    <p>
      Beam keeps your workouts organized — exercises, sets, reps, and weights — so your history stays consistent and easy
      to review. Everything is stored locally on your device and can be exported in open formats. Your data is yours.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy built in</h2>
    <p>
      No accounts. No ads. No tracking. If you choose to share anonymous usage data, it helps improve the app. Nothing
      personal ever leaves your phone.
    </p>
